Changing XTerm foreground or background colour

1. open a terminal
2. run 'touch ~/.Xresources' without the quotes (this will create an empty file titled ".Xresources" in the home directory)
3. open .Xresources with your preferred text editor
4. add these lines to .Xresources -
    XTerm.vt100.background: black
    XTerm.vt100.foreground: grey
5. replace "black" and "grey" with your preferred colour - see "https://critical.ch/xterm/" for a list of colours supported by XTerm
6. run 'xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources' (without the quotes) in a terminal
7. run 'sudo systemctl daemon-reload' (without the quotes) in a terminal to reload all system services
8. open XTerm to see if your changes were successful
